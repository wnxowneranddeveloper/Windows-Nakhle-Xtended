# Windows-Nakhle-Xtended
The OS tailored for you.
hello, its george joseph nakhle, ever since the end of
windows 10 came around, i wanted to help people switch to
linux, but then a lightbulb struck in my head, it said “what if
you had a os that could support the anti cheat and adobe
programs yet dosent need the ridicously high
requirements?” well i turned that idea into a ntlite made iso
for my family that somehow turned into a shareable iso for
(almost) everyone so if you have the proper requirements,
please get this its much better (supposedly)
